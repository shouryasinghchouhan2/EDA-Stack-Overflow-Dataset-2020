# EDA-Stack-Overflow-Dataset-2022

## Introduction

In this project, we will analyze the StackOverflow developer survey dataset using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries. The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow. We will limit our analysis to the following areas:

Demographics of the survey respondents and the global programming community Distribution of programming skills, experience, and preferences Employment-related information, preferences, and opinions

## Data Preparation & Cleaning

We started by importing the required libraries, reading the CSV file containing the survey data, and selecting a subset of columns with relevant data for our analysis. We also read the CSV file containing the schema for the survey data to understand the meaning of each column. We converted some columns into numeric data types while ignoring any non-numeric value. We removed entries where the age was less than 10 or greater than 100 years and ignored entries where the value for the WorkWeekHrs column was greater than 140 hours.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We started by analyzing the demographics of the survey respondents and the global programming community. We found that most of the respondents were from the United States, followed by India, and the United Kingdom. We also found that the number of male respondents was much higher than the number of female respondents. We analyzed the age distribution of the respondents and found that most of them were between 20 and 40 years old.

Next, we analyzed the programming skills, experience, and preferences of the respondents. We found that most of the respondents had been coding for less than 10 years and had a university degree. We also found that most of the respondents used Python, followed by JavaScript and HTML/CSS. We analyzed the desired programming language of the respondents for the next year and found that most of them wanted to learn Python. We also analyzed the learning resources and found that most of the respondents used online courses and tutorials to learn new programming skills.

Finally, we analyzed the employment-related information, preferences, and opinions of the respondents. We found that most of the respondents were employed full-time, worked 40 to 50 hours per week, and were satisfied with their job. We also found that most of the respondents considered the work-life balance and the salary to be the most important factors when looking for a new job.

## Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed the StackOverflow developer survey dataset and gained insights into the demographics, programming skills, experience, and employment-related information of the survey respondents. We found that most of the respondents were male, had been coding for less than 10 years, and used Python as their primary programming language. We also found that most of the respondents were employed full-time, worked 40 to 50 hours per week, and were satisfied with their job. This analysis can be used by developers and employers to understand the current trends in the programming industry and make informed decisions.
